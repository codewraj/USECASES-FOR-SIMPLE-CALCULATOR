# USECASES-FOR-SIMPLE-CALCULATOR

## 1. Digit Buttons (0–9)
Numbers 0–9: The core set of number buttons for basic arithmetic.

Button Design: Simple buttons with numeric labels.

Example:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Users tap these buttons to input digits into the display.


## 2. Decimal Point (.)
Decimal Point: A button to input the decimal separator for floating-point numbers.

Button Design: A small "." depending on the locale.

Example:

.

Allows users to enter decimals like 3.14.


## 3. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Addition: Adds two numbers.

Example: 5 + 3 = 8

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Example: 9 - 4 = 5

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.

Example: 6 * 7 = 42

Division: Divides the first number by the second.

Example: 8 / 2 = 4

Modulus: Returns the remainder of division.

Example: 10 % 3 = 1


## 4. Input Validation and Error Handling
Division by Zero: Handle attempts to divide by zero.

Example: If 5 / 0 is attempted, return an error message: "Cannot divide by zero!"

Invalid Inputs: Check if the user enters a non-numeric value and prompt for correct input.


## 5. Fractional and Decimal Numbers
Allow for decimal points in calculations.

Example: 5.3 + 4.7 = 10.0


## 6. Equality (Result Calculation)
Calculate the Result: A button to compute the result when the user has entered a valid expression.

Example: Press = to get 5 + 3 = 8


## 7. Clear Button
Clear Current Input: A button to clear the current number or operation being entered (like an "AC" or "C" button).

Example: If the user has typed 7 + 5, clicking "C" should clear the input field.


## 8. Reset
Reset: Resets the calculator's state to its initial condition.


## 9. Simple UI Enhancements
Button Styling: Add different styles to operators (+, -, =, etc.) to make them more visually distinct, so users can quickly identify them.
